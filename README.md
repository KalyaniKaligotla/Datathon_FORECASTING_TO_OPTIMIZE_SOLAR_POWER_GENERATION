# Datathon_FORECASTING_TO_OPTIMIZE_SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION
A solar power generation company wants to optimize solar power production and needs the prediction model to predict ‘Clearsky DHI’, ‘Clearsky DNI’, ‘Clearsky GHI’. The data is ten years at an interval of every 30 mins with the following data points:
0) Year : Years from 2009 to 2018
1) Month : ranges from 1 to 12 months from the given list of years
2) Day : 31 days from the 12 months of each year
3) Hour : 24 hours from every day of month in given year
4) Minute : the values are recorded for every 30 minutes of a hour
5) Clearsky DHI : The amount of radiation from the sky
6) Clearsky DNI : The amount of radiation reflected from the particles in the atmosphere
7) Clearsky GHI : The amount radiation reflected from the parallen surface of the ground
8) Cloud Type : The different types of clouds ranging from 0 to 9
9) Dew Point : The temperature the air needs to be cooled in order to achieve a relative Humidity
10) Temperature : The degree of Hotness in the atmosphere
11) Pressure : The force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth
12) Relative Humidity :The amount of water present in the atmosphere
13) Solar Zenith Angle: The angle between the Sun's rays and the vertical direction
14) Precipitable Water: The depth of water column in the atmosphere
15) Wind Direction : The direction of flow of wind
16) Wind Speed : The rate at which the wind flows
17) Fill Flag : A flag value
